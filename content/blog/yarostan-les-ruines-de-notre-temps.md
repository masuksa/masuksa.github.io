I've recently discovered the release *Les Ruines de Notre Temps* by **Yarostan**, a band from the french city of Marseille.
It's a screamo EP, released in 2016.
(A follow up album has been released in 2019.)

The first song, *Les ruines de notre temps* is an opening.
Starting with some voices talking, it then comes to a conclusion with some lonely and distorted guitars, setting the mood for the rest of the EP.

*Les coeurs se fanent*, the second track begins with some heavy guitars.
It then features some screamo vocals, which don't appear too much in the EP overall.
As an ending, the tempo speeds up, while it gets less heavy, and feature a more atmospheric feeling.

The third song, *Aversion / Les cors pour assi√©ger la nuit*, also has got some nice instrumentation.
It is an alternance of heavy parts and more quieter ones, with some vocals sometimes.
As it is the longest track, having some breaks definitely helps catching the breath.

*Antarctique* is a progression, with a heavy and slow begininning speeding up, before it goes more calm.
Yet the pressure is rising, and we get to a heavy part, which then gets more aerial, while still having heavy drums.

It's a relly nice EP, with both the screamo voices, and the interesting instrumentation.
