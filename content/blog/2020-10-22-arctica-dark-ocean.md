I like atmospheric music, but it's rarely as ethereal as *Dark Ocean* by **Arctica**.
This whole album is very aerial and you're never sure if the music is real or if you're just dreaming.
The vocals have an echoey tone. It comes and fades just like some waves.
The piano uses both bass and high-pitched parts which goes well with the singer.
Overall, the tone of this album is cold and quite dark, but it can also be a source of appeasement.
It develops several layers of interpretation which is very promising.

Unfortunately, this is the only realease of **Arctica** and seeing how it was made in 2017, it may be that the project was put aside.

And to top it all, if you watch it on Youtube, the [video of *Years Of Silence*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmbCjTWZRNM) with a cold sea in the background is perfect.
