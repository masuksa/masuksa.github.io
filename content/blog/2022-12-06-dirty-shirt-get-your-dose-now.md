**Dirty Shirt** is a metal band from Romania.
They have recently come to my attention thanks to their album *Get Your Dose Now!*, thanks to the radio emission <a href="https://blogs.radiocanut.org/noisepollution/" lang="fr">Noise Pollution</a>.

This album blends [Nu Metal](/tags/nu-metal) with [Folk Metal](/tags/folk-metal).
I have to say this works quite well.
I do not know much about Romanian folk music, but it definitely appears on *Get Your Dose Now!*.
The folk aspect is well integrated with the metal part.
Folk Metal is not new, but it still amazes me how well folk and metal can blend together.

This is a very lively album.
I haven't paid that much attention to the lyrics.
However, I understand it's full of humour.
From the cover art to the album title, it's clear that they're talking about a burning topic : the Covid-19 pandemic.
While I may have missed some subtelty, I think it's quite clear that they incite people to get vaccinated, which is a positive message.
The way it's done is still light and fun and I'm happy with it !
