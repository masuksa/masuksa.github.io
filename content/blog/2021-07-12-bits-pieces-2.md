#### Frozen Night & Prince Whateverer - Lunar Eclipse III

I will start today's blogpost with some symphonic metal.
This one begins quite quietly, with a sort of astral ambience.
Quite naturally, the metal part emerges, with a melodic guitar taking the lead.
The vocal part follows with the beautiful voice of Holly Frances Royle.
After this developement, the song tones down a bit.
It's time for some violin by Andra Stefan.

Over all, this song is a stellar atmospheric one.
The guitar helps reinforcing the "epic" side of it, while the orchestration and singing creates the more ethereal aspect.

You can purchase this song on [Bandcamp](https://frozennight.bandcamp.com/album/lunar-eclipse-iii) or listen to it on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qef-IRLj9YY).

#### Jyc Row - Sun of the Night VIP

Jyc Row has released a new version of *Sun of the Night*.
The VIP stands indeed for *Variation In Production*.
It still features Felicia Fererre as the singer, but adds a cello part by Yoed Nir, and has overall a better polish.
It's a very regal and epic song, fitting for her majesty Daybreaker (the queen whom the song is about).
Jyc Row is mostly an epic orchestral composer, and this song is a prime example of what he can achieve.
The cello solo is amazing and adds a lot to this already great song.

#### Eccentrifuge - Cadence's Heart

To end this article on a quieter note, here is **Eccentrifuge**'s *Cadence's Heart*.
In this version (from the "repack"), there are some vocals added.
It starts with them, which creates a smooth layer on which to add the instruments.
The instrumentation is very calm with quiet pizzicati, some harp, some piano, a bunch of wind instruments.
The song then slowly develops to a more percussive and punchier finale.
It's overall a very peaceful song, and both this version and the instrumental one are great.
