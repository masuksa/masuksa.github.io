**Brimid** has released a new album.
It's a [darksynth](/tags/darksynth) set of instrumental tunes.
While this is one of their most electronic albums, with very few of the guitars featured in previous one, it still retains the artist's character.
This is also a concept-album, with the tracks forming a story about a people standing up against a powerful company ruling their world.
You can find more about the story in [Brimid's album thread](https://mastodon.art/@Brimid/105494385180484716) and on [Bandcamp](https://brimid.bandcamp.com/album/-).

From the start, *ＩＧＯＪＩＮ* is dark.
The prologue sets the tone immediately.
Yet some are a bit lighter and softer, such as *Erinyes: I. Whispers Of The Righteous* or *Epilogue: ＩＧＯＪＩＮ*.
But overall, the dystopian mood of a cyberpunk universe is well present.
Despite those moment of respite, it's clear that the Igojini don't live very happy lives.

Overall, this album is well crafted.
This is some quality synthwave here.
I'll be listening to it for a long time.
