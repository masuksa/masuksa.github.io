#### Vayle Mystery - *Doomsday* & *This is Gallifrey*

I don't know **Vayle Mystery** very much, except for *Doomsday* and *This Is Gallifrey*, two musics from *Doctor Who*.
*Doctor Who* soundtrack, while not being my favourite one (works from John Williams or Joe Hisaishi still keeps a high position in my heart), has some great themes.
And the guitar and instrumentation work done by Vayle does wonder.
It's a true instrumental piece, loaded with feelings.
And I didn't need to watch the serie to feel the tension in *Doomsday*, coming to a climax, and then the hope in *This Is Gallifrey*.

#### Be'Lakor - An Ember's Arc

**Be'Lakor** is a [melodic death metal](/tags/melodic-death-metal/) band which released their first album in 2007.
The name comes from the Daemon Prince of Chaos also known as the Harbinger, from Warhammer Fantasy Battle.
*An Ember's Arc* begins with an accoustic intro, setting up quite a rapid pace.
It is followed by some more melodic death metal in the middle, with a calm break in the middle.
This is a fine piece, which, without being atmospheric metal itself, will still give such a vibe.

#### Mamiko Noto - Karinui

This is a very calm and soothing song from the anime *Jigoku Shoujo* (*Hell Girl* in english), sung by **Mamiko Noto** (能登 麻美子), who is also a voice actress in *Jigoku Shoujo*.
The song is composed by *Masara Nishida* and the lyrics written by *Hitomi Mieno*.
I don't know the anime at all, this is one of those, which I know only from songs I listen.
I really enjoy the tranquility of this song.
