I’m not good with music genre, and as such, I have a hard time defining what Abandonne is. It’s atmospheric, definitely, and draws inspiration from the Red and Anarchist Black Metal scene. Since it’s release, about a year ago, I’ve returned time and time again to Souffre qu'à mes transports je m'abandonne en proie, a mesmerizing live recording. The guitar has a very raw and noisy sound, never playing demonstratively, but the groan from a rusty machine. It’s accompanied by keyboard drone, setting the tone of the track, as well as a repetitive background sound. While this combination may seem minimalist, it produces a surprisingly rich result. The almost half an hour track is both soothing and passionate, a blend I cannot quite describe. It’s fair to say that this A-side is my favourite.

While the rest of the album has no particular flaw, I have found it less remarkable, perhaps overshadowed by Souffre qu'à mes transports je m'abandonne en proie. They have a different production, owning to the fact that they aren’t a live recording, but fit well within the album as experimental droning noisy black metal. It’s still a solid album overall, and I encourage to check it out.
