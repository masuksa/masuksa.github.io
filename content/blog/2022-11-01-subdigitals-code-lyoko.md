One of the best-known thing about Code Lyoko is its opening.
It's a very catchy song, especially well-known in France.
Something less known is that there is a music band appearing in some episodes of the show.
The students of Kadic appear to be fans of this group, first called Subsonics, then Subdigitals.

I haven't listened to the French version.
I didn't know it existed, so I'll probably try it later.
To be honest, despite the fact that french is my mother tongue, I've watched Code Lyoko mostly in English. 

The songs from this album have a definite 2000s feel.
It's a rock album, but also includes a lot of electronic instruments and effects.
According to [an interview (in French) with the fictitious band members](https://www.codelyoko.fr/dossiers/subdigitals.cl),
their influences are Red Hot Chili Peppers, U2, as well as Green Day, Gorillaz and Linkin Park.
This is quite a diverse selection, but it fits this album quite well.

I won't introduce each and every song, but there are some that I really love.
Indeed, while all are pretty solid, some stand out to me.
*Angel of Mine* is quite beautiful and sad.
Its emotion is very far from *A World without Danger*, the title song that everybody know.
However they both are full of passion.

*Virtual World* captures the 2000s beliefs about computers, where they were seen in a more positive light than currently.
They were deemed more as an empowering tool for mankind and the individuals than the alienating tools of huge corporations and authoritarian states of now.
People could dream of booting a computer, building and playing things with their imagination the only limit.
I think the lyrics capture this hopefulness well :

> We have found a way to play
> 
> We are way up high
> 
> Flying out
> 
> In this virtual world

There are more sad and calm songs, like *Time to Cry*.
The pace is slower, and the voice of Camille Souvorof gives the song an ethereal atmosphere.
From this, we get onto *Secret Life*.
This is about avatars in the cyberspace, a theme definitely fitting Code Lyoko.
So far, the song can be divided into either calm and sad ones, or more energetic and positive others.
Yet *World With My Eyes* is on the calm side, but has a hopeful tone.

The end credits song *Break Away* is the angriest song of the lot.
Unsurprisingly, its lyrics fit the rage, as it's about rejection.
As this is the english version, *A World Without Danger* is in English as well.
The singer is not Julien Lamassonne, who performs on the french one, but Noam Kaniel, who's sang and composed a lot of TV songs.

I feel like this is a great album
