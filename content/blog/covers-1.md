## Graveworm - Fear of the Dark

*Fear of the Dark* is an amazing song by the British New Wave of Heavy Metal **Iron Maiden**.
And it's a song which has some amazing covers.
Here is the one by **Graveworm**, a [black metal](/tags/black-metal/) band from italy.
What makes me love this cover is the atmosphere it develops.
The song by *Iron Maiden* is a mysterious one, tainted with fear of the unknown.
**Graveworm** have kept a polished atmosphere, still scary, but much more grandiose, with all the symphonic elements black metal can develop.
