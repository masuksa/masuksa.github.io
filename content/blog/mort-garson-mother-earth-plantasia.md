Sometimes, I want to listen to something calming, something nice, something fresh.
Then, I may pick **Mort Garson**'s *Mother Earth's Plantasia*.
Composed in the 1970s on the Moog, one of the first synthesizer, this records is dedicated to "plants and the people who love them".
This record features a soothing, round electronic sound.
It's a synthesized symphony for plants, giving a nice fresh breeze to the listener.
It's not the kind of ambient music which can be overwhelming.
The melodies are both simple and rich enough to fulfil your heart.
After being forgotten for a while, it has been brought back to attention in the recent years.
I hope all the plant-lovers here will enjoy it.
