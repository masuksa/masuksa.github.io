*Impetus* is a nice neo-classical album.
It features some varied tunes, although never very turbulent.
Some, like *In Between Worlds II* or *Emotions (Part II)* are quite sad and melancholic.
Other, such as *One Story of Thoughts* or *Impetus* are lighter, and deliver a shine of hope.
Different instrument appear on this record : piano, violin, cello, but also some more electronic sounds.
Overall the mix is finely made, and lets each instrument bring its own part to the sound.
This creates a quiet atmosphere, letting the subtle feelings of the different tracks glow and express their own quiet moods.
