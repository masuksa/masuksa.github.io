![Timeless Departure](https://coverartarchive.org/release-group/1edd2e57-e425-3ec4-94b3-311de0bf7c78/front.jpg)


*Timeless Departure* is an album by [death metal](/tags/death-metal/) band Skyfire released in 2001.
It features some symphonic elements, which will probably remind you of some [black metal](/tags/black-metal/) groups.
This makes the record particularly interesting to me, by giving it a sense of huge scale not often heard in death metal.

*Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find any official buying link for this album.
However, the group has a [Bandcamp page](https://skyfiremusic.bandcamp.com/) with their latest release, *Liberation in Death*.*
