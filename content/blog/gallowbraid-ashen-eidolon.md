**Gallowbraid** is a one-person band by Jake Rogers, who also plays in Caladan Brood and Visigoth.
It has released only one album, in 2010, but it is an interesting one.
*Ashen Eidolon* is a melodic/atmospheric black metal album.

The first track, and the one giving the name to the album, is probably the most iconic.
It's really long and the melody stays in mind.
There is then a break with *Autumn I*, which is acoustic and more calm, before going back to the more "black metal" sound with the rest of the album.
To me, listening to this album transports me along with the rhythm and melody, and it's a wonderful experience.

Interestingly, the song *Stone of Remembrance* features the type of voice which can be heard in **Caladan Brood** songs.
It must also be noted that, similarly to Caladan Brood covers, the one for *Ashen Eidolon* features a lot of nature, going well with the atmospheric tone.
