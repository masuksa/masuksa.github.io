This is a simple roadmap for the site, with features I want to work on.

  * [ ] Search function :
    Zola already exports data which can be used for a search function.
    However I need to get a compatible search engine.
  * [x] Support for multiple themes :
    I plan on letting users choose their favourite theme from several I'd make.
    The theme switch would be done in JavaScript.
